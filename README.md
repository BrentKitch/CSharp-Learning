# C# Learning
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to hold example projects i have done during my dive into learning C#

### Basic Calculator 
This code is my first take at an extremly simple calculator in C#. I chose not to use the math functionality for the power operation in order to to have fun with a for loop. To the power of only works with positive integers but the other operations work with any numbers. 

### Calculating Averages
This code was an exercise project for the MSSA class. I used this exercise to help teach other students in the class some syntax and programming logic. In the spirit of keeping it simple for others to follow along and learn from there is some repetition in the code that could get broken into methods. Example of that would be making a true average method and sum method that i could call passing optional parameters and return the values instead of just printing to the console. The printing to the console for each of those functions was a requirement of the exercise so it didn't make sense to make a lot of changes just for the last function. 

### Simple Task Tracker
This is a simple task tracker that i made for a quick class project. The task tracker displays a list of tasks that can be imported from a .txt file.
